###1. DESCRIPTION

PDSTRIP is a hydrodynamic strip code for seakeeping. It computes ship motions
for monohulls including sailing boats.


###2. PREREQUISITES
Building and using pdStrip will require some additional packages.

* git
* gcc
* g++
* qt5-qmake
* qt-sdk
* gnuplot
* gfortran

If you are in Ubuntu (or other Debian based distribution) you can install these by issuing the following command

 `sudo apt-get install git gcc g++ qt5-qmake qt-sdk gnuplot gfortran`

###3. COMPILATION ON LINUX

1. Specify your compiler in the Makefile (in a default Linux installation this will automatically be set to the gcc compiler)

2. type make


###4. EXAMPLE USAGE ON LINUX

1. change directory to examples

2. run the example with the following command:

###5. NOTES ON COMPILATION ON WINDOWS

pdstrip.f90 is known to crash the Salford FTN95 compiler versions 4.7.1 and 4.8.0.
Version 4.7.x works if you choose the "Win32 debug" or "Win32 release" compiler
option.
