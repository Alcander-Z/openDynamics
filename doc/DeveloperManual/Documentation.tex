\chapter{Documentation}
The openDynamics documentation is written in \LaTeX. For scientific documentation which contains many references and equations this is by far the easiest environment, and benefits over MS Word and OpenOffice in it's ability to be version controlled and handle references in particular. The documentation is based on a template document and a bibtex library.

New documents can be produced by copying the document.tex and Makefile files from the template directory into a document directory. All references should be added to the common bibtex library (library.bib).
